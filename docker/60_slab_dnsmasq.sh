# dnsmasq in this instance serves three purposes:
# * Hand out management ip addresses on the out-of-band management
#   network. This is configured in the dnsmasq_config file and
#   mounted as a volume file, as well as in the config file.
# * Assist in network booting over the data network, with variables
#   set in the config file.
# * Serve up ip addresses to the data network, also set up in
#   the config file.
